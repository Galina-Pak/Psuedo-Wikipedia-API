Were planets formed in situ? Or are orbital changes relatively frequent? What determined the different deep layering of the solar planets? Was there ever a collision of the Earth with another planet Theia, giving birth to our satellite? There is compelling evidence, such as measures of a shorter duration of the Earths rotation and lunar month in the past, pointing to a Moon much closer to Earth during the early stages of the Solar System\r\n",
